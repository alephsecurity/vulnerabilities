title: Challenge response can be retried indefinitely upon failure.

---
The `unlockKey` value in a lock using Sciener firmware can be brute forced
through repeated challenge requests, compromising the lock's integrity.
Challenge requests take place during the unlocking process, and contain a random
integer between 0 and 65535. Challenge requests can be repeatedly prompted and
responded to without any limitations, until the correct integer is discovered.
Successfully completing the challenge request provides the `unlockKey` value
that can be used to open the lock.
