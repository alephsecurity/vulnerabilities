---
An XSS issue in `emfd` executable in Ruckus Wireless Unleashed through 200.7.10.102.92 allows a remote attacker to execute JavaScript code via an unauthenticated crafted HTTP request.
Every ajax request to "/admin/_wla_cmdstat.jsp" has to contain an "updater" attribute. The response reflected this value in the ajax response as an "id" attribute.

Information about the exploitation of this vulnerability can alos be found in our  [DEFCON 28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt3mJlnODHU) talk.


## Proof Of Concept ##
