severity: 'medium'
alephid: ALEPH-2024005
cve: CVE-2023-7007
date: '2023-12-21'

title: The TTLock app does not properly verify that it is connected to a real lock.

---
The Sciener server does not validate connection requests from the Gateway G2,
allowing an impersonation attack. An attacker can impersonate the MAC address of
a Gateway G2 that has established a connection with a lock, then connect to
Sciener servers and receive messages instead of the legitimate Gateway G2. This
can facilitate access of the `unlockKey` value.
