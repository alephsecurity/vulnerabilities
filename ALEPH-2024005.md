title: A Gateway G2 can be impersonated using its MAC address

---
The Sciener server does not validate connection requests from the Gateway G2,
allowing an impersonation attack. An attacker can connect to Sciener servers,
impersonate a Gateway G2 that has established a connection with a lock by using
its MAC address, and receive messages instead of the legitimate Gateway G2. This
can facilitate access of the `unlockKey` value.
