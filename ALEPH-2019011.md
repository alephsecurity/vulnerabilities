title: 'Remote command injection via a crafted HTTP request (cmdPacketCapture)'

---

Remote command injection via a crafted HTTP request, caused by insufficient input validation

`cmdPacketCapture()` function in `emfd` executable runs `system()` with insufficient input validation on `mac` attribute. As a result a crafted POST request with attribute `xcmd=packet-capture` to the web interface page `/admin/_cmdstat.jsp` injects OS command.
