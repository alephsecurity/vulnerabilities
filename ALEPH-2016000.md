A vulnerability in Nexus 5X's bootloader allows an attacker to obtain a full memory dump of the device. The vulnerability can be exploited by either physical attackers, or by non-physical ones having ADB (Android Debug Bridge) access to the device. One possible scenario where a non-physical attacker can have ADB access is by first targeting an ADB-authorized developer’s PC and infecting it with malware. Another way is by using malicious chargers targeting ADB-enabled devices. Using such chargers requires the (naïve) victim to authorize the charger once connected
The attacker reboots the phone into the well-known `fastboot` mode, which can be done without any authentication. A physical attacker can do this by pressing the ‘Volume Down’ button during device boot. An attacker with ADB access can do this by issuing the `adb reboot bootloader` command. The fastboot mode exposes a USB interface, which on locked devices must not allow any security sensitive operation to be commanded. However, what discovered was that if the attacker issued (via the fastboot USB interface) the `fastboot oem panic` command, the bootloader would be forced to crash:
```
[38870] fastboot: oem panic
[38870] panic (frame 0xf9b1768):

```  

The problem is that in the vulnerable versions of the bootloader, such a crash caused the bootloader to expose a serial-over-USB connection, which allowed fetching a full memory dump of the device, using tools such as QPST Configuration.

To illustrate the severity of the attack, as the victim, I set the device password to `buggybootload3r` and then searched it in the memory dump:

```terminal
> hexdump DDRCS0_0.BIN | grep -10 bootloa

As one can see, the password can be found on the fetched memory dump. Physical attackers can then successfully boot the platform, which further allows them to impersonate the user, access data stored on the device and more.
