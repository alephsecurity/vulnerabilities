title: Attacker within IR range can install arbitrary firmware over the air

An attacker located within the IR range of an AC unit utilizing the Electra Smart Kit can communicate with the unit and

The WiFi can be used to direct the unit to a malicous update server. The malicious update server can be used to return
arbitrary firmware that will be flashed onto the device.
