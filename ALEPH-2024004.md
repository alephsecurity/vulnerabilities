title: The TTLock app does not properly verify that it is connected to a real lock.

---
The TTLock App does not employ proper verification procedures to ensure that it
is communicating with the expected device. This can be utilized by a threat
actor who introduces a device that spoofs the MAC address of the lock, allowing
for further exploits, such as compromising the `unlockKey` value.
