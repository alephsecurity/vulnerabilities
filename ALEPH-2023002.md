title: A WiFi hotspot with a known password is always availiable on unconfigured units

---
Before the unit is configured and connected to the cloud, it automatically opens a WiFi hotspot. The password
to the hotspot is always the name of the hotspot (with the characters `SSID` replaced with `PASS`).

Thus, an attacker can always connect to an unconfigured unit within the WiFi range (can be done outside the
building), and leverage that connection to exploit additional vulnerabilities.
