title: 'Ruckus CLI (ruckus_cli2) jailbreak'
---
This is a command injection vulnerability via a crafted CLI command.

`/bin/ruckus_cli2` is a CLI used by Ruckus for user interaction and run commands by their web interface. `ruckus_cli2` has a `script` menu that can run limited set of stored scripts. `exec` command in that menu is vunrable to path traversal, and can be used to run `/bin/sh` in order to escape to a busybox shell. 

Information about the exploitation of the vulnerability can be found in our [blog post](/2020/01/13/ruckus-wireless/) or the [36C3 talk](https://youtu.be/bmGtG55Zz1Q?t=802).
