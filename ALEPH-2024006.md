title: The Kontrol Lux lock can be forced to process arbitrary unencrypted messages.

---
The Kontrol Lux lock supports plaintext message processing over Bluetooth Low
Energy, allowing unencrypted malicious commands to be passed to the lock. These
malicious commands, less then 16 bytes in length, will be processed by the lock
as if they were encrypted communications. This can be further exploited by an
attacker to compromise the lock's integrity.
