title: Protocol downgrade on the TTLock app can expose the unlock key.

---
A specially crafted message can be sent to the TTLock App that downgrades the
encryption protocol used for communication and can be utilized to compromise the
lock, such as by providing the `unlockKey` value. During the challenge request
process, if a message is sent to the app unencrypted, and with a specific set
of information, the corresponding message that contains the `unlockKey` value
will be provided unencrypted.
