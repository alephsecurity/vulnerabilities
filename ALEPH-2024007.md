title: The firmware of the Kontrol Lux lock can be updated w/o AuthZ/AuthC

---
The Kontrol Lux lock firmware update mechanism does not authenticate or validate
firmware updates if passed to the lock through the Bluetooth Low Energy service.
A message can be sent to the lock with a command to prepare for an update,
rather than an unlock request. This allows an attacker within Bluetooth range to
pass an arbitrary malicious firmware to the lock, compromising its integrity.
