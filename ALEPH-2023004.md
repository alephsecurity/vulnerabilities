title: Attacker within WiFi range can cause unconfigured units to connect to a malicious update server

---
An attacker located within the WiFi range of an unconfigured (i.e., not connected to the cloud) unit can communicate with the unit and
cause the unit to connect to a malicious WiFi, that will redirect the unit to a malicous update server upon boot.

The malicious update server can be used to return arbitrary firmware that will be flashed onto the device.
