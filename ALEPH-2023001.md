title: Credentials for connecting to the MQTT server hardcoded inside the firmware

---
The connection to the MQTT server used to control the AC over the Internet uses a password that
is hardcoded into the firmware (i.e., it's shared between all the units and can be easily obtained).

On top of that, the firmware on these versions (v4/v5) of the units is not updateable, so changing
the password on the server without breaking functionality is not possible.
