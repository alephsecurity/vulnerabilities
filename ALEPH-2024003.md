title: TTLock virtual keys can be reused even after invalidation.

---
The TTLock App supports the creation of virtual keys and settings. They virtual
keys are intended to be distributed to other individuals through the TTLock app,
for unlocking and locking the lock. They can also be set to only be valid for a
certain period of time. Deletion of these keys only occurs client side in the
TTLock app, with the appropriate key information persisting within the
associated lock. If an attacker acquires one of these keys, they can utilize it
to unlock the lock after its intended deletion or invalidation.
